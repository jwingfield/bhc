    ShortDesc: Join us for a talk from Martin Wills from the Historic Towns Trust about the Mapping Bradford’s History project. The project produced an historical map of Bradford showing its history and development, and surfaced some interesting stories about Bradford’s past.
    LongDesc: >
        The Historic Towns Trust invite you to join us on 11th July to celebrate the city of Bradford through mapping its history. The talk is about 
        the Historic Towns Trust’s An Historical Map of Bradford publication, which shows the fascinating history of the city centre, and the two 
        conservation areas of Manningham and Little Germany. The map is built on extensive research, drawing information from many archaeological and 
        historical resources, brought together to show the historical development of the city. The talk will highlight how we create our maps, how we 
        elivered our Bradford project and share the stories and learnings that the publication has uncovered, which are surprising even its authors in 
        creating a new and more detailed narrative of Bradford’s history. Following the talk there will be a stall and a small exhibition space, giving 
        more detail about the project, with the opportunity to purchase the publication along with other maps produced by the Historic Towns Trust.

    Times: 10.30am to 3.00pm
    ShortDesc: South Square is delighted to be hosting an exhibition by Alicja Mrozowska, work to date and explores identity, memory, and cultural hybridity through bold portraiture and playful abstraction.
    LongDesc: >
      <p>Alicja Mrozowska’s paintings navigate the layered terrain of identity, memory, and 
      cultural hybridity through bold portraiture and playful abstraction. Rooted in personal 
      history and shaped by the nuances of migration, her work draws from everyday imagery, 
      reconfiguring the familiar to question how place and experience inform who we are. 
      Yorkshire Pudding and Pickled Cabbage marks the most expansive presentation of 
      Mrozowska’s work to date, bringing together paintings from 2017 through to 2025.</p>
      <p>Combining large gestural brushstrokes with recurring motifs and symbolic references, 
      her compositions balance between the recognisable and the obscure, inviting viewers 
      into a space where identities blur, overlap, and reform. Through a practice grounded in 
      both intuition and process, Mrozowska weaves together collected images - personal, 
      cultural, and imagined - layering them with oil paint and paper to construct portraits 
      that resist singular readings. Her figures emerge not as fixed subjects but as 
      open-ended reflections of internal complexity, shaped as much by social context as 
      by intimate experience. At once serious and light-hearted, the exhibition revels in 
      contradiction, drawing attention to the tensions between surface and depth, play and 
      constraint, self and other. Mrozowska’s work ultimately asks: how do we perform, 
      obscure, or reveal who we are - especially when those performances take place within 
      the structures of cultural expectation?</p>
      <p>Alicja Mrozowska is a Polish visual artist and painter currently based in Leeds. Her 
      practice explores identity, the concept of ‘home’ and social constructs through a 
      range of mediums including oil painting, film photography, installation, and 
      construction. Drawing from personal experience, surroundings, and relationships, 
      she reflects on the complexities of migration and belonging. Mrozowska graduated from 
      the University of Salford in 2018 with a BA (Hons) in Visual Art. Since then, she has 
      exhibited widely and taken part in collaborations and group residencies, while also 
      devising and leading creative workshops in the UK, Poland, and Germany. Her 
      process-driven approach weaves together collected images and intuitive mark-making to 
      create narrative-rich, multidimensional works that prompt curiosity, vulnerability and 
      acceptance.</p>

    EventTitle: Yorkshire Pudding and Pickled Cabbage
    VenueAddress: South Square Centre, Thornton Road, BD13 3LD
    VenuePhone: 01274 834747
    VenueWebsite: southsquarecentre.co.uk
    Date: 12/07/2025
    Times: 10.30am to 3.00pm
    ShortDesc: South Square is delighted to be hosting an exhibition by Alicja Mrozowska, work to date and explores identity, memory, and cultural hybridity through bold portraiture and playful abstraction.
    LongDesc: >
      <p>Alicja Mrozowska’s paintings navigate the layered terrain of identity, memory, and 
      cultural hybridity through bold portraiture and playful abstraction. Rooted in personal 
      history and shaped by the nuances of migration, her work draws from everyday imagery, 
      reconfiguring the familiar to question how place and experience inform who we are. 
      Yorkshire Pudding and Pickled Cabbage marks the most expansive presentation of 
      Mrozowska’s work to date, bringing together paintings from 2017 through to 2025.</p>
      <p>Combining large gestural brushstrokes with recurring motifs and symbolic references, 
      her compositions balance between the recognisable and the obscure, inviting viewers 
      into a space where identities blur, overlap, and reform. Through a practice grounded in 
      both intuition and process, Mrozowska weaves together collected images - personal, 
      cultural, and imagined - layering them with oil paint and paper to construct portraits 
      that resist singular readings. Her figures emerge not as fixed subjects but as 
      open-ended reflections of internal complexity, shaped as much by social context as 
      by intimate experience. At once serious and light-hearted, the exhibition revels in 
      contradiction, drawing attention to the tensions between surface and depth, play and 
      constraint, self and other. Mrozowska’s work ultimately asks: how do we perform, 
      obscure, or reveal who we are - especially when those performances take place within 
      the structures of cultural expectation?</p>
      <p>Alicja Mrozowska is a Polish visual artist and painter currently based in Leeds. Her 
      practice explores identity, the concept of ‘home’ and social constructs through a 
      range of mediums including oil painting, film photography, installation, and 
      construction. Drawing from personal experience, surroundings, and relationships, 
      she reflects on the complexities of migration and belonging. Mrozowska graduated from 
      the University of Salford in 2018 with a BA (Hons) in Visual Art. Since then, she has 
      exhibited widely and taken part in collaborations and group residencies, while also 
      devising and leading creative workshops in the UK, Poland, and Germany. Her 
      process-driven approach weaves together collected images and intuitive mark-making to 
      create narrative-rich, multidimensional works that prompt curiosity, vulnerability and 
      acceptance.</p>

    EventTitle: A Bingley Byron Walk - Celebrating the life and poems of John Nicholson
    VenueAddress: Starting at the Ling Bob pub (BD15 0JU) walking to the Malt Shovel (BD16 1BG) via Wilsden Cemetery and Goit Stock Falls.
    VenuePhone: ""
    VenueWebsite: www.woollyfringe.com
    Date: 12/07/2025
    Times: "12.15pm"
    ShortDesc: A walk led by local poet and stand up historian Glyn Watkins. From The Ling Bob, Wilsden to the Malt Shovel, Harden. The walk will start and finish with Nicholson poems about beer, and stop at Wilsden Cemetery and Goit Stock Falls for Nicholson poems about those places.
    LongDesc: John Nicholson was Bradford’s first famous poet. He died 14th April 1843, aged 52, after falling in the River Aire at midnight, whilst he was drunk. His funeral a few days later at All Saint’s Churchyard Bingley had a crowd of over a thousand; and until a few decades ago school children around Eldwick used to be taken to Nicholson’s Rock, where he carved his name and wrote some of his poems. The walk is part of a campaign by Glyn Watkins to revive interest in Nicholson and his works. The walk will be a little under 4 miles long and travels footpaths over potentially slippery rocks, down steep slopes and past nettles, so sensible clothes and footwear and reasonable fitness are a must.<br/>Tickets via Eventbrite.
